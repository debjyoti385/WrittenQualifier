Open source projects on API libraries available in Github and other collaborative platforms enables researchers to collect data from above mentioned social sites. Social media data is broadly divided into
 % \cite{batrinca2015social} :
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\em Historic data sets:} Previously accumulated and stored social/news, financial and economic data.
  \item {\em Realtime feeds:} Live data feeds from streamed social media, news services, financial exchanges, telecom services, GPS devices and speech.
\end{itemize}

Historical datasets are relatively easy to collect than real-time feeds.
