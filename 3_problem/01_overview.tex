\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Many research has revealed that analyzing tweets in volume can measure different population characteristics, including public
health measures \cite{paul2011you, paul2012model, eichstaedt2015psychological, barros2018disease, mueller2018crowdbreaks, karami2018characterizing}.
Research analysis like correlating influenza rates w.r.t geography (spatial) and time \cite{signorini2011use}, state level food and health behavior analysis \cite{nguyen2017social}, predicting heart disease rate mortality rate based on twitter information \cite{eichstaedt2015psychological}; are motivating examples to carry out such analysis for improving and create for public health.
All these above adhoc analysis inspire us to build a general system for comprehensive analysis.
In this work, I will present overview of architechture and desired features to build such system or tools.
