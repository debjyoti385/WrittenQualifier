\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Reinforcement learning (RL) is the area of machine learning that deals
with {\em sequential decision making}.
Sequential decision-making is a task of deciding, the sequence of actions
to perform in an uncertain environment in order to achieve some
goals. Sequential decision-making tasks cover a wide range of possible
applications with the potential to impact many domains, such as
robotics, healthcare, smart grids, finance, self-driving cars, and many
more.

Inspired by behavioral psychology (e.g. Sutton \cite{sutton1984temporal}) reinforcement
learning (RL) proposes a formal framework to this problem.
The main idea is that an artificial agent may learn by interacting with
its environment, similarly to a biological agent.
I will dive more into the details how a general RL problem is formally represented and what are key components involved in the framework in Section \ref{part_a}.
